# User-Curated Feeds Configuration
#
# This file defines custom curated event feeds that combine:
# 1. Hand-picked events (by UID)
# 2. Auto-selected events based on preferences
#
# Each curated feed automatically:
# - Drops past events
# - Includes new matching events from sources
# - Updates daily with the main pipeline
#
# Example curated feeds:

# Example 1: Family-Friendly Events
