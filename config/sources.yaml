# Northwoods Events v2 — hardened sources
# Notes:
# - For TEC sites we use type: tec_rest so main() can fall back to HTML on 403/404 or empty.
# - GrowthZone and Simpleview stay on their dedicated parsers.
# - URLs are the stable listing/home roots for each platform.

  # Oneida’s events are exposed under a custom slug rather than /events/.
  # Using tec_html directly improves reliability vs REST here.
